Currently,  he is working for a company called Open Water where he  takes part in developing their ecommerce  platform using React Native. Over the past decade he has been given the oppurtunity to code for some amazing companies and startups.He initially started  coding primarily in Ruby and Ruby on Rails. However , as  time went on and technology progressed he switched  focus to Javascript to take advantage of the capabilties it affords. It has been about three years since since  that deciscion was made and he is now coding exclusively in JS  doing everything from building API's with node , mobile apps with React Native and  websites like this one using React.
